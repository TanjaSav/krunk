# Profile Pictures

This folder should contain 5 profile picture options for users to choose from.

Based on the Figma design, you need to add these 5 images:

1. `circle.png` - Default circle profile picture (can use existing `/images/circle.png` as fallback)
2. `shape2.png` - Dark blue circle with glowing light blue abstract figure
3. `shape3.png` - Light-colored sheep/goat head with glasses
4. `shape4.png` - Patrick Star from SpongeBob SquarePants
5. `shape5.png` - Yellow emoji with distressed expression

## How to add the images:

1. Export the 5 profile picture options from Figma
2. Save them in this folder with the names:
   - `circle.png` (or copy from `/images/circle.png`)
   - `shape2.png`
   - `shape3.png`
   - `shape4.png`
   - `shape5.png`

The component will fallback to `/images/circle.png` if any image is missing.
